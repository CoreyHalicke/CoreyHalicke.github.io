If you were to ask me months about why I think variables and methods were important or how essential they truly are and why you should focus on learning them to the fullest; I would not have nearly the same appreciation that I do now. As I thought the idea of them were cool and convenient, I never realized how much they are used in everyday programming and how essential they are. If I were to suggest ensuring you learn something to its entirety, these would both be on the list as it is the foundation of how to become a developer.
