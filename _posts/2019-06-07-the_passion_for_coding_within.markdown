**What got me into coding and having a true passion for coding?**
I never really knew I would be into the whole "coding" thing; but I have always found a passion for electronics in general. Then I started a company which lead me to making it an e-commerce site. While using a pre-made theme for the site, there were still some things I wanted to edit outside of what the theme allowed me to actually edit. Which lead to reading and youtubing how to create certain looks or features in the code. Once I dabbled in it for while I found an incredible passion for how limitless coding can truly be. And that is where the journey began.
