Where to start... This journey has been so fulfilling. Yes at times the truest of frustrations kick in when code doesn't work as planned; but isn't that what this is all about? Without those frustrations and feeling like you are hitting the wall, then you will never really get to live the reward of climbing over that wall and feeling so fulfilled and accomplished. Those little milestones have made this journey so worth it.

As I thought about what topic I would like this project to lean towards, I was able to narrow it down to 2 topics. Cars and stocks; 2 great interests of mine. My mind was winding through all the thoughts of the paths each one could go on and I came to the conclusion of going with stocks.

Stocks have always been so fascinating to me but I never knew where to start in the learning process. After reading some books, listening to some audiobooks, and watching YouTube, I still didn't have much luck. There is so much to learn but there doesn’t seem to really be a simple starting point to actually learn about them. One day, I just went in and invested in a couple random stocks in sectors that I found interesting to me. From there I naturally was watching those stocks rise and fall, day after day, learning little by little just by “being in it” rather than trying to learn from a far kind of “tip toeing in”.

This entire concept is the same exact way I felt about coding. I have always loved the idea of software engineering; learning to code, being able to develop my own apps, website, tools, databases, etc… I would google, YouTube, and read as much as I could but always seemed to be missing that very important base of knowledge to build on top of; which always left me feeling very lost at the end. I started thinking that the only choice would be to go back to school to get a Computer Science degree to have a steady base to then learn what really interests me (coding). I tried multiple bootcamp prep courses and it felt good to build a small base at a rapid pace compared to if I were to go back to get another Bachelor’s degree. 

It was then I knew I had to shift directions and go the bootcamp route and haven’t looked back since. Now that I am “in it” the knowledge tree is growing exponentially and I can’t get enough of it!
